# Activity_Checker
Retrieves Last Logins, Start-Up Apps, Users on the PC (even the hidden ones).
just open the Dist file and run the program and you can see the instructions, unfortunately i wasnt able to execute the bat codes because of the UAC
so you have to do them manually

**NOTE : THE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK IF IT WAS ON DESKTOP OR IN ONE OF THESE DIRECTORIES:
(
    "C:\\Windows\\System32",
    "C:\\Program Files",
    "C:\\Program Files (x86)",
    "C:\\Windows",
